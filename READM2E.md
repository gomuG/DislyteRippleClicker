# Dislyte auto clicker for Ripple Dimensions
- Uses Capture2Text(OCR) to recognise Dhalia and Ye Suhua ripple dimensions words. Once detected, the program will click on the specified area.

# Controls
- Ctrl + R : Restarts the program/script
- Ctrl + Q : Specify the area the program should look at
- Ctrl + F1 : Start/Stop the search program (State of program is denoted by Green/Red)

# Things to take note
- The emulator must always be the active/focused window(i.e click on the emulator before starting) when **starting** the program
- Chat must be open and emulator must always be the one on top (Most emulators have Pin to top, so use that if necessary)
- The program copies the text to the clipboard so you cannot **copy/paste** anything while it is running.
- The program doesn't close the ripple window for you
- Accuracy isn't 100%
